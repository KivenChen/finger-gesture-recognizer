# finger-gesture-recognizer
This is a ResNet-50 to recognize numeric fiinger gestures from 0 to 5, originally from the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.

## Current Problems
- The training set accuracy and the test set accuracy have both reached 100%, but the accuracy for practical photos are very low.
- I've already applied grey-scale preprocessing to all the training example, but it didn't help.

## What to Try
- More training examples
- Different preprocessing methods.
