# finger-gesture-recognizer
This project originated from an Assignment *Resnet* of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

**The changes are as follows:**
1. the training set has been expanded to 5400 64*64 pictures
2. the test set has been expanded to 600 pictures
3. applied grey-scale to all the images (although proved to be hardly useful)

## To-Do
- Add even more datasets
- Apply random crop, random brightness and random contrast to all the train set
